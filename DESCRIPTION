Description: Calculate the distance between single-arm observational studies using covariate information to remove heterogeneity in Network Meta-Analysis (NMA) of randomized clinical trials. Facilitate the inclusion of observational data in NMA, enhancing the comprehensiveness and robustness of comparative effectiveness research. Schmitz (2018) <doi:10.1186/s12874-018-0509-7>.
